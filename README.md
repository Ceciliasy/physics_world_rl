Training RL algorithms for active physical inference

Humans exhibited rich and informative strategies that selectively revealed objects' properties of interest while minimizing causal "noise". We would like to explore how a variety of artificial agents solve this task, and what components are required to achieve human levels of performance, and whether similar or different strategies emerge.

## On-going first phase
Develop a python port of simulation environment based on pybox2D to test control algorithms. The idea is to collect the state space and the informational rewards by utilizing pre-defined action space. Simulator design and reward formulation are adapted from this [paper](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S001002851730347X?token=99E4A9B2B68F6724DCCBA56A91667C5C0F8DA9436EEB3E021D5B50318A71897D73E995F08741D5B6837F742F89DCD71B).
